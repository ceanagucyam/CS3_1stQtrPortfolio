## **Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.**

## **Key Points I Found Interesting**


- Public school teachers will get overload and overtime pay this school year.
- PhilHealth will cover kidney transplant expenses.
- Hiring more guidance counselors.

## **Key Points I Found Weird**

-  “Kaya sa mga nakikipagsabwatan upang kunin ang pondo ng bayan, mahiya naman kayo sa inyong kapwa Pilipino”,  and then some of the officials clapped or gave a standing ovation, even though some of them were corrupt. 
- The random acknowledgement of  PNP Chief Torre as a “New Champion,” which was very unnecessary, especially in a SONA.

## **Reflection**

After watching the SONA 2025, I noticed that the president pointed out some of the complaints of the Filipinos and talked about the country’s progress. What surprised me was when he acknowledged that the corruption committed by some government officials, and said that they should be ashamed of their fellow Filipinos. Other positive developments were mentioned, such as overtime pay for public school teachers, PhilHealth covering kidney transplant expenses, and adding more guidance counselors, which are honestly nice and would be even better if they are implemented. I hope that he truly wants to listen to the people’s problems and keep his promises.

President Marcos calling out government officials suspected of corruption in flood control projects also stood out to me. He once mentioned that the recent storms are part of the “new normal,” which caught my attention. Although it’s true that we need to accept the reality that extreme weather conditions happen, the government must take action to address them, such as implementing proper flood control projects. Nevertheless, I really hope that there will be lots of progress and meaningful change in our country that will truly uplift the lives of all Filipinos.
