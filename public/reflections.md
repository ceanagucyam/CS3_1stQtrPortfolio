# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
1. **Variable Declaration** - Here, I learned the different keywords (var, let, const) used to declare a new variable in JavaScript. I think this is one of the things that should really be understood because this is where we can start forming a code by using the declared variables. Since I constantly use this in coding, I believe that this is something I know very well.
2. **JavaScript Operations** - I understood the concept of using arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, %, because these have been useful in coding ever since Python. These are also simple mathematical operations, so I believe that this is something I have already mastered. I have also learned the different comparsion operators such as ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, which have been essential in my codes, especially when coding loops.
3. **JavaScript Basic Statements** - These statements include document.getElementById(id.)innerHTML and console.log(). These statements have been crucial for me in coding, especially when something needs to be output. Over time, I was able to understand the concept of the basic statements in JavaScript.
4. **Control Statements** - Under this, there are conditional statements such as if, else if, and else. These were also used in C++, so after many coding exercises, I think I now know this topic well.
5. **Conditional Statements : Switch Statements** - Switch statements were also used in C++, and now that they are used again in JavaScript, they have been useful to me when there are multiple actions for multiple conditions. The definitions and examples taught in class also really helped me understand this topic.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Loop Control Statements** - Although statements like while, do while, and for were taught in class and taught last year, they are still quite unclear to me. Even after reviewing when and how to use them, I still get confused sometimes about applying them in my code. There are some hard problems that require these, and I still have a difficult time in using them.
2. **Declaring Functions** - I know the simple concept of this topic, but when it comes to complex problems, it becomes difficult for me to understand. I still haven't mastered this topic, but I hopefully think I'll get there soon.
3. **Processing Function Output** - I think that if I don't fully understand declaring functions, I won't be able to understand this topic well. Since this requires using the return statement, I find it complicated.
4. **Event Handlers** - This topic is really confusing to me since I don't think we have gone deeper into it in class. This topic involves onclick and onload event handlers, which I don't fully understand.
5. **JavaScript Operations** - Sometimes, I encounter problems where I get the idea of what to do, but I don’t use the right operator. For example, when using logical operators, I still get confused between logical AND (&&) and logical OR (||). I also sometimes mix them up when they are combined together.


# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items. 
My plan of action in order to help myself in understanding further the topics I listed, is to practice regularly. I will work on practice exercises that involve using loop control statements, declaring functions, processing function output, event handlers, and logical operators. I will also ask help from my friends who I think have mastered coding, because I'm comfortable discussing my coding problems with them, and I believe they can help me. If possible, I will also try my best to consult with Sir Roy. Other than that, I can search on Google for more resources and practice exercises.  



# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
### Effective
1. For me, doing the bonuses that Sir Roy gives us is really effective. This is because they give me a chance to improve my scores in case I get a low grade in an assessment. By doing the bonuses, I can raise my grade back up.
2. Another effective activity is discussing with my classmates, especially my seatmates. I enjoy working together on codes during class, and by learning their thoughts and ideas, they help me understand the exercises or topics better.

### Not Effective: 
1. I noticed that I often get sleepy in class during double periods, because they usually involve long discussions and lectures. I think it would be better if there were also times for doing exercises and activities with the class.
2. When I review, I sometimes rely only on the information in KHub, and then I lack the motivation to apply what I learned through coding. Because of this, I unfortunately don’t get to understand the topics very well.
